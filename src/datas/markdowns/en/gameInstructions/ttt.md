**Rules:** A family classic, this game is played on a three by three grid. Players alternate placing X and O pieces, respectively, until one player has made a line of three concecutive pieces, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

**Variants:** You are playing a misére variant! Misére tic tac toe is the “opposite” of the traditional game. You win if you can force the OTHER player to place a three in a row! In other words, your goal is to place all of your pieces without accidentally connecting a run of three!

**Score:** Your score will be the number of tie moves you make. This means moves that our strong solvers have calculated will bring you to a tie ending state.
