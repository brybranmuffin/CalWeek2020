**Rules:** This game is played on a 6 by 4 grid with gravity. This means pieces fall to the bottom open position in the column they are dropped into. The players alternate dropping red and black pieces, aiming to make a run of four in a row. Like tic tac toe, runs can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.

**Score:** You will be scored based on the total number of winning and tie moves you make.
