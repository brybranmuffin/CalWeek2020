**Rules:** The first player is the head of the snake and the second player is the tail. Players alternate turns moving one space up, right or left into any adjacent open square. Once a player has moved to an open spot, it becomes occupied and neither player is allowed to move into that space. The game ends when there is no more room for a player to move. The last person to make a legal move wins.

**Scoring:** Your score will be the total number of winning moves you make.
