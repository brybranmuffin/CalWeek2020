**Rules:** The game starts with a board with six vertices (dots) and edges (lines between dots) between every single pair of vertices. The players, blue and red, alternate picking and coloring an uncolored edge. You lose if you make a triangle of only your color. This triangle must have vertices as endpoints-- intersecting lines do not make a new vertex. In other words, you win if you force your opponent to make a closed triangle of their color.

**Score:** Your score will be the total number of winning moves you make.
